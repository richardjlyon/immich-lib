# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** A Rust library for the Immich API focused on duplicate management, paired with a binary tool that prioritizes metadata completeness over file size when selecting which duplicate to keep.

**Core requirements:**
- Library successfully authenticates and queries Immich duplicate API
- Analysis correctly identifies metadata-richer files that Immich would discard
- Generated JSON is complete, auditable, and human-reviewable
- Execution downloads originals before any deletion
- Zero metadata loss—no file with richer EXIF deleted in favor of metadata-poor alternative

**Constraints:**
- Pure Rust—library and binary, no Python/JS components
- Relies on Immich's duplicate detection being correct
- Visualizer must stay lightweight

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| - | Trust Immich duplicate detection | Their detection works, only selection logic is broken |
| - | Metadata completeness priority | GPS, timezone, camera info matter more than file size |
| - | Two-stage workflow | Allows review without 2000 manual confirmations |
| - | Download originals for backup | Full recovery possible, not dependent on Immich trash |
| 01-01 | Rust 2024 edition | User has Rust 1.92.0, latest edition available |
| 01-01 | clap env feature | Environment variable support for CLI args |
