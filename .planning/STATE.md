# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** A Rust library for the Immich API focused on duplicate management, paired with a binary tool that prioritizes metadata completeness over file size when selecting which duplicate to keep.

**Core requirements:**
- Library successfully authenticates and queries Immich duplicate API
- Analysis correctly identifies metadata-richer files that Immich would discard
- Generated JSON is complete, auditable, and human-reviewable
- Execution downloads originals before any deletion
- Zero metadata loss—no file with richer EXIF deleted in favor of metadata-poor alternative

**Constraints:**
- Pure Rust—library and binary, no Python/JS components
- Relies on Immich's duplicate detection being correct
- Visualizer must stay lightweight

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 8 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2/2 | 8 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (4 min), 01-02 (4 min)
- Trend: Consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| - | Trust Immich duplicate detection | Their detection works, only selection logic is broken |
| - | Metadata completeness priority | GPS, timezone, camera info matter more than file size |
| - | Two-stage workflow | Allows review without 2000 manual confirmations |
| - | Download originals for backup | Full recovery possible, not dependent on Immich trash |
| 01-01 | Rust 2024 edition | User has Rust 1.92.0, latest edition available |
| 01-01 | clap env feature | Environment variable support for CLI args |
| 01-02 | 30-second timeout | Reasonable default for API requests |
| 01-02 | url::Url type | Proper URL manipulation, not string concatenation |
