# Phase 06 Plan 05.2-01: Unique Base Images Summary

**32 unique Lorem Picsum base images per scenario, X6/X8 removed, fixtures regenerated for proper CLIP isolation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 18 min
- **Started:** 2025-12-27T11:12:00Z
- **Completed:** 2025-12-27T11:30:00Z
- **Tasks:** 4
- **Files modified:** 7

## Accomplishments

- Removed X6 (HEIC) and X8 (RAW) scenarios that couldn't be generated without proprietary encoders
- Downloaded 32 unique photos from Lorem Picsum (one per remaining scenario)
- Updated all fixture definitions to use scenario-specific base images (base_w1.jpg, base_c1.jpg, etc.)
- Regenerated all fixtures successfully with no manifest errors

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/testing/scenarios.rs` - Removed X6Heic and X8Raw enum variants and related code
- `src/testing/fixtures.rs` - Updated all 32 fixtures to use unique base images
- `src/testing/detector.rs` - Removed X6/X8 detection code
- `tests/fixtures/base/ATTRIBUTION.md` - Updated with Lorem Picsum attribution
- `tests/fixtures/base/base_*.jpg` - 32 new unique base images (replaced 10 shared images)
- `tests/fixtures/x6/` - Removed directory
- `tests/fixtures/x8/` - Removed directory

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove X6/X8 instead of stubbing | Can't generate valid HEIC/RAW without proprietary encoders; manifest inconsistencies worse than missing scenarios |
| Lorem Picsum over Unsplash Source | Unsplash Source API was returning HTML redirects; Lorem Picsum provides direct image downloads |
| Seed-based URLs for consistency | Using `picsum.photos/seed/{scenario}scenario/600/400` ensures reproducible unique images |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- Unsplash Source API (`source.unsplash.com`) returned HTML redirect pages instead of images
  - Resolution: Switched to Lorem Picsum API which provides direct image downloads

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for 06-05-03: Edge case tests (F1-F7, X1-X5, X7, X9-X11) with proper CLIP isolation.

Each scenario now has its own visually distinct base image, preventing CLIP from grouping unrelated scenarios together during duplicate detection.
